* Description
  Edit mode for [[https://github.com/ch11ng/exwm][EXWM]]

  Similar to [[https://github.com/alpha22jp/atomic-chrome][atomic-chrome]]

  except this package is made to work with EXWM
  and it works with any editable element of any app

  The idea is very simple - when you invoke the edit,
  it simulates =C-a= + =C-c= (select all & copy), or simply =C-c= if you already have something pre-selected.
  Then it opens a buffer and yanks (pastes) the content so you can edit it,
  after you done - it grabs (now edited text) and pastes back to where it's started

  Now that opens interesting possibilities, for example:
  - when typing in ChromeDevTools console, you can initiate exwm-edit, then change major mode to whatever your favorite javascript mode is, have all the JS syntax highlighting, flycheck, etc;
  - you can edit GitHub issues and wiki pages using markdown-mode and use your syntax checker and thesaurus;
  - quickly modify url in browser address bar using multiple-cursors and regexp-replace things;
  - edit and modify code snippets with ease in Slack;
  - etc. and etc.

* Customization

In your ~init.el~ file, put the following ~use-package~ declaration before
the call to ~exwm-enable~, since adjustments to ~exwm-input-global-keys~
only take effect before EXWM is enabled.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package exwm-edit
    :config
    ;; Edit text in an *exwm-edit* buffer
    (add-to-list 'exwm-input-global-keys '([?\C-c ?\'] . exwm-edit--compose))
    (add-to-list 'exwm-input-global-keys '([?\C-c ?\'] . exwm-edit--compose))

    ;; You can use hooks to, e.g., set desired mode:
    (defun ag-exwm/on-exwm-edit-compose ()
      (spacemacs/toggle-visual-line-navigation-on)
      (funcall 'markdown-mode))

    (add-hook 'exwm-edit-compose-hook 'ag-exwm/on-exwm-edit-compose))
#+end_src

* Keybindings

In the ~*exwm-edit*~ buffer, you can use ~C-c '~, ~C-c C-'~, ~C-c C-c~, or
whatever key you have bound to ~save-buffer~ to insert the buffer
contents into the X program.  To discard the contents of the
~*exwm-edit*~ buffer and go back to the X program, press ~C-c C-k~.
