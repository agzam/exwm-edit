* Description
  Edit mode for [[https://github.com/ch11ng/exwm][EXWM]]

  Similar to [[https://github.com/alpha22jp/atomic-chrome][atomic-chrome]]

  except this package is made to work with EXWM
  and it works with any editable element of any app

  The idea is very simple - when you press the keybinding,
  it simulates =C-a= + =C-c= (select all & copy),
  then opens a buffer and yanks (pastes) the content so you can edit it,
  after you done - it grabs (now edited text) and pastes back to where it's started

* Keybindings
  Default keybindings are just like in Org-mode (for editing source blocks):

  ~C-c '​~ or ~C-c C-'​~  - edit

  ~C-c '​~ or ~C-c C-c~  - finish editing

  ~C-c C-k~ - cancel editing
* Customization
  You can use hooks to set desired mode, etc, e.g.:

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    (use-package exwm-edit
      :config
      (defun ag-exwm/on-exwm-edit-compose ()
        (spacemacs/toggle-visual-line-navigation-on)
        (funcall 'markdown-mode))

      (add-hook 'exwm-edit-compose-hook 'ag-exwm/on-exwm-edit-compose))
  #+end_src
